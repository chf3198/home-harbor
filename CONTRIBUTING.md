# Contributing to HomeHarbor

Thank you for your interest in HomeHarbor! 🏡

## Current Status

**This is a portfolio project** created to demonstrate AWS serverless architecture skills for a Realtor.com Staff Software Engineer position. As such, I am **not accepting external contributions** at this time.

## Why No External Contributions?

1. **Interview Portfolio**: This codebase serves as a demonstration of my individual technical abilities
2. **Code Ownership**: All code must be attributable to me for interview discussions
3. **Scope Control**: The project has a defined scope aligned with specific interview criteria

## What You Can Do

### 🐛 Report Issues
If you find a bug or security vulnerability, please [open an issue](https://github.com/chf3198/home-harbor/issues). I appreciate responsible disclosure.

### 💡 Suggest Features
Feature suggestions are welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/chf3198/home-harbor/issues). While I may not implement them during the interview period, they help improve the project vision.

### 🍴 Fork & Experiment
Feel free to fork this repository and experiment! The MIT license allows you to:
- Use the code for your own projects
- Modify and adapt it to your needs
- Learn from the patterns and architecture

## After the Interview

Once the interview process concludes, I may open the project to contributions. Watch this space for updates!
